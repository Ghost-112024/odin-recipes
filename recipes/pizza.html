        <h2>Description</h2>
         
        <p>This is a quick and easy Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza recipe to make when youre feeling
            lazy. If you get home from a long day feeling tired, and don't feel like
            cooking, this is a great thing to make! 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
           Keep in mind that you can make a large, medium, small pizza of your
           choosing depending on your situation. For that reason, I will not 
           list a specific amount of sauce, or cheese to use. Go with what
           works for you!
        </p>

                    your own, that's even better!)
